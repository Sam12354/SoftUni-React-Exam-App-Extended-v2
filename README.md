Since this project utilizes cookies for authentication, you need to create a .env file to store sensitive information, such as the JWT_SECRET. Steps to Set Up the .env File:

Create a .env file in the root directory of the server (if it doesn't already exist).

Add the following environment variable to the .env file:

JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here

Replace your_secret_key_here with a strong, secure secret key used for signing JWT tokens and refresh the server.

Ensure that the server is able to read environment variables by using the dotenv package (which should already be included in the server dependencies).
